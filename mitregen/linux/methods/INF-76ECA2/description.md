As an added benefit, here are some code examples of how to implement INF-76ECA2 in various environments:
1. For Linux systems using Docker or Kubernetes, you can use the following configuration file:
```
[docker]
log_driver = json-file
log_opt = --format=json
log_path = /var/log/containers/container_name.log
log_level = info
```
2. For Windows systems using Hyper-V, you can use the following configuration file:
```
[hyperv]
log_driver = json-file
log_opt = --format=json
log_path = /var/log/containers/container_name.log
log_level = info
```
3. For cloud systems using Amazon Elastic Container Service, you can use the following configuration file:
```
[ecs]
log_driver = json-file
log_opt = --format=json
log_path = /var/log/containers/container_name.log
log_level = info
```
Note that these code examples are just for demonstration purposes and should not be used in production environments without proper testing and validation. Additionally, the log files generated by INF-76ECA2 should only be accessible to authorized personnel with appropriate security clearances.

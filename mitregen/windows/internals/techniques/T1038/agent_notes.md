Technique T1038, "Scheduled Tasks," is a method of executing a program at a specific time and date without user intervention. Scheduling tasks allows for automation of routine processes, such as system updates or batch file execution, and can be useful for businesses to schedule important operations outside of traditional work hours.
To execute scheduled tasks in Windows, you need to create a task with the following properties:
1. Task Name - Specify the name of the task.
2. Description - Provide a brief description of what the task does.
3. Start Time - Select the date and time when the task will start executing.
4. Recurrence - Choose whether to repeat the task daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or never.
5. Trigger - Select if you want the task to execute immediately or at a specific time.
6. Actions - List all actions that need to be performed by the scheduled task.
Once created, scheduled tasks can be accessed and managed through Task Scheduler, which is available in the Control Panel of Windows 10. To access Task Scheduler, follow these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel on your Windows device.
2. Click the View by option to show all Tasks (including scheduled tasks).
3. Select the task you want to manage and click Change.
4. Modify any of the task properties as needed.
5. Click OK when finished making changes.
Scheduled tasks are useful for automating routine operations, such as system updates or batch file execution. However, it is important to ensure that scheduled tasks do not conflict with other system processes and should be regularly reviewed for malicious activity.

Mitigation Strategies for MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1038 (Windows):
- Limit administrative privileges by using Windows Group Policy Objects to restrict the privileges of users and groups within Active Directory.
- Disable unnecessary services such as NetBios, WINS, LLMNR, etc., which can increase the attack surface for an adversary.
- Use up-to-date antivirus software that includes protection against malicious code injection attacks.
- Conduct regular security audits to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in the system.
- Implement a robust password policy that requires complex passwords with different characters, special symbols, numbers, and capitalization.

Sure, here's a Purple Team Playbook for MITRE ATT&CK technique T1047 - Registry Key Manipulation (Win):

1. Identify the target system and gather relevant information such as domain controller, service account, user permissions, and network topology.
2. Conduct reconnaissance to identify all available Windows registry paths and their associated values. This can be done using tools like WDigest, RegistryKeyScan, RegInspect, and ShellBags.
3. Identify any potential areas of vulnerability by reviewing the values for suspicious keys such as System, Security, Services, Startup, Scheduled Tasks, Users, or UserDefined.
4. Use tools like RegEx or PowerShell scripts to identify patterns in the data and perform data analysis on the key contents.
5. Develop a set of test scenarios based on the identified vulnerabilities and develop attack strategies for each scenario.
6. Execute the test scenarios using authorized credentials, simulating the behavior of an adversary attempting to exploit the vulnerability.
7. Review the results and identify any false positives or negatives, making adjustments as necessary.
8. Share the findings with the Blue Team for further analysis and remediation recommendations.
9. Continuously monitor and update the playbook based on new information and changes in threat landscape.

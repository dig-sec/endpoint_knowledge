Here are the detection rules for MITRE ATT&CK technique T1053.005 on Windows:

1. Event ID 4688 or higher, indicating that a privilege escalation attempt has occurred due to an exploit or vulnerability. This event will also be generated if the user account privileges are changed without explicit permission from an administrator.

2. Event ID 3001 or higher, indicating that an unauthorized process is attempting to load into memory and execute code.

3. Event IDs 4789-4795 and 5068 or higher, indicating that a program has been executed with the highest privilege level available (SYSTEM or LOCAL SERVICE). These events are generated when an application attempts to elevate its privileges beyond what is normally allowed.

4. Event ID 1132 or higher, indicating that a suspicious process has attempted to access protected system memory. This event may indicate an attempt by malware to gain access to the kernel space of the operating system and execute code there.

5. Event IDs 4687-4690 and 5067 or higher, indicating that a privileged program (such as an administrator tool) is attempting to access protected system memory without explicit permission from the user. This event may indicate an attempt by malware to gain access to the kernel space of the operating system and execute code there.

By monitoring these events and comparing them with known indicators of compromise, such as known exploit scripts or malicious programs, security analysts can detect potential privilege escalation attempts and mitigate threats before they cause significant damage to the network or devices.

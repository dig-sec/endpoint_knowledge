Mitigation strategies for the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1055 (Windows) include:

1. Disable autostart feature of programs
To prevent Windows from automatically starting a program, set up an Autostart Manager or Group Policy to block autostarting of programs. This will make it harder for attackers to start malicious programs on the system without user interaction.

2. Use secure network protocols
Use secure network protocols such as Secure Shell (SSH) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) to access sensitive data remotely instead of using standard TCP/IP connections that are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

3. Update software regularly
Keep all software on the system up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates to prevent attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated versions.

4. Use antivirus software
Install and configure an antivirus software to scan for and remove malware from the system, including any malicious programs that may have been installed by a drive-by download attack.

5. Enable Windows Defender Firewall
Enable Windows Defender Firewall to prevent unauthorized access to the system through unsecured network connections.

6. Use encryption for sensitive data
Use strong encryption algorithms and protocols such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect sensitive data from being intercepted during transmission over insecure networks, including public Wi-Fi hotspots.

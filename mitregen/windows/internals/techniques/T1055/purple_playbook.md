Sure, here's a purple team playbook for the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1055 (Fileless Execution) on Windows:

Phase 1: Threat Discovery and Analysis

- Identify systems that may be vulnerable to fileless execution attacks using MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
- Analyze network traffic for indicators of fileless execution activity, such as outbound DNS queries and suspicious behavior in Windows Event Viewer logs.
- Use threat intelligence sources to identify potential attackers or malware samples that may be associated with fileless execution attacks.

Phase 2: Incident Response

- Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor for fileless execution activity on vulnerable systems.
- Collect endpoint data using EDR tools, including system information, process telemetry, and network traffic analysis.
- Analyze collected data to identify suspicious behavior and potential indicators of fileless execution attacks.
- Investigate the incident using a combination of automated and manual methods, such as user forensics and memory dump analysis.
- Contain and remediate any compromised systems.

Phase 3: Defense Evasion

- Implement controls to prevent fileless execution attacks on vulnerable systems, including whitelisting approved processes and using application control features.
- Regularly update antivirus software and other security solutions to detect new threats.
- Train employees to recognize potential phishing attacks and other social engineering tactics that may be used in conjunction with fileless execution attacks.

Phase 4: Continuous Monitoring

- Use active threat hunting techniques to proactively identify and respond to potential fileless execution threats on vulnerable systems.
- Implement incident response drills and exercise plans to improve response times and communication during a real attack.
- Conduct regular security audits and risk assessments to identify areas for improvement in the overall defense strategy against fileless execution attacks.

Technique T1059.007 on Windows is a PowerShell execution with administrator rights, which requires the user to have administrative privileges in order for it to work properly. To mitigate this attack, you can implement the following strategies:

1. Limit access to administrative privileges by configuring Group Policy Objects (GPOs) or by using Active Directory-based controls. This will make it more difficult for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to Windows systems.
2. Enable the PowerShell remote signing block policy, which prevents the execution of unsigned scripts in remote sessions. You can set this policy on individual machines or centrally via GPOs.
3. Use a network-level firewall to block incoming traffic from unauthenticated users. This will help prevent malicious actors from executing malicious PowerShell code from external sources.
4. Conduct regular security audits and updates to ensure that all software is up-to-date with the latest patches, which will help mitigate known vulnerabilities in Windows systems.

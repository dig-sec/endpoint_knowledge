Sure, here's a purple team playbook for MITRE ATT&CK technique T1059.007 on Windows:

1. Phishing campaign targeting employees with the fake URL and email containing a malicious attachment or link that can execute PowerShell scripts to run commands and install malware in the system.
2. The phishing emails are disguised as legitimate emails from the company, such as an invoice, payment reminder, or update notification.
3. Once the victim clicks on the URL or opens the email attachment, a PowerShell script is executed that downloads and executes malware in the system.
4. The malware will then establish persistence, create backdoors, gather information from the system, and exfiltrate data to a remote server controlled by the attacker.
5. To prevent this technique, organizations can implement security awareness training for employees to recognize phishing emails and avoid clicking on suspicious links or attachments. They can also use robust email filtering solutions that block malicious emails and URLs. In addition, regular patching of software vulnerabilities can help mitigate the risk of PowerShell scripts executing malware in systems.

Sure, here's a purple team playbook for MITRE ATT&CK technique T1059.010 on Windows:
1. Identify the vulnerability: Use tools like Nmap or Shodan to identify which version of the Microsoft Windows operating system is being used and which patches are outstanding.
2. Create a custom exploit: Develop a custom exploit for T1059.010 using techniques such as Metasploit, PowerShell Empire, or Hacking with Kali Linux. Ensure that the exploit checks if the version of Windows is vulnerable to T1059.010 and only executes the payload if necessary.
3. Test the exploit: Use a purple team environment (e.g., Blue Team) to test the effectiveness of the custom exploit against a simulated Red Team environment. Use this feedback to refine the exploit as needed.
4. Deploy the exploit: Once the exploit is confirmed effective, deploy it in a production environment and monitor for any indicators of compromise (IOCs) or abnormal behavior that may indicate an attacker has successfully exploited T1059.010.
5. Update patches and configuration settings: Continue to update patches and configurations as necessary to ensure the vulnerability is no longer present in the production environment.

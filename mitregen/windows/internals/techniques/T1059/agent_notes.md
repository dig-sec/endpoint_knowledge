Agent Research Notes for MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1059 (Windows)

Technique: Executing a program or script with elevated privileges (T1059)

Programs that run as Administrator on Windows require administrator permissions to perform their actions. The attacker may exploit this privilege by executing malicious code, such as shellcode or scripts, with elevated privileges. By running programs and scripts as administrators, the attacker can execute commands without being prompted for authorization or access denials.

To achieve T1059 on Windows, the following steps are typically performed:

1. Identify a program that requires administrator permissions to run. For example, PowerShell is installed by default with Administrator privileges and can be exploited as an attack vector. 
2. Execute the program or script with elevated privileges using cmd.exe or Windows Explorer. 
3. Inject malicious code into the program or script using techniques such as DLL injection or remote execution of shellcode or scripts. This can be done by manipulating registry keys, files, and directories, or through network communication channels like HTTP, DNS, and SMTP. 
4. Execute the malicious code with elevated privileges to gain unauthorized access or execute commands on the system.

To mitigate this technique, organizations should implement robust security measures such as:

1. Disabling unnecessary administrative privileges for users who don't require them
2. Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and password policies to prevent unauthorized access or brute force attacks
3. Regularly updating software and patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities in programs that require administrator privileges 
4. Monitoring for suspicious activity such as unusual network traffic, file transfers, or executable files being downloaded without authorization

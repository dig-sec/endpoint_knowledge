T1106 is a MITRE ATT&CK technique that involves using tools to scan and collect data from Windows systems. To mitigate this threat, here are some strategies:

1. Enable Windows Defender Antivirus (Windows 8 and above): This feature can help detect and block threats before they execute.
2. Use third-party antivirus software: There are many third-party antivirus software programs that can help prevent attacks from T1106. Some popular ones include Bitdefender, Kaspersky, Norton, and AVG.
3. Disable unnecessary services: You can disable non-essential services to reduce the attack surface of your system. This includes services like Remote Assistance, Microsoft SQL Server Browser, Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service, etc.
4. Use application whitelisting: Application whitelisting tools can help prevent unauthorized applications from running on a system. Some popular examples include AppLocker and Software Restriction Policies (SRP).
5. Use encryption: Encrypting your data can make it more difficult for attackers to access sensitive information. This includes full-disk encryption, file/folder encryption, and database encryption.
6. Keep all software updated: Install all Windows updates as soon as possible to keep the system secure. Additionally, regularly update third-party software to fix vulnerabilities and prevent attacks from T1106.

The purple team playbook for MITRE ATT&CK technique T1106 is designed to identify and mitigate the potential security risks posed by malicious code in Windows environments. The following are some key steps that should be taken when implementing this playbook:

Step 1: Identify potential attack vectors: The first step of the purple team playbook is to identify all potential attack vectors that could be used to exploit MITRE ATT&CK technique T1106. This includes understanding how malicious code can be injected into processes, how it can be hidden from detection, and how it can be executed with elevated privileges.

Step 2: Create a baseline: Once the potential attack vectors have been identified, create a baseline of normal behavior for Windows systems. This should include identifying which processes are typically running at various times and under what permissions they run.

Step 3: Detect anomalies: The next step is to monitor system activity for any anomalous behavior that could indicate the presence of malicious code. This can be done by setting up alerts or automated responses that trigger when suspicious activity occurs.

Step 4: Isolate and analyze suspicious activity: If suspicious activity is detected, it should be immediately isolated from the rest of the system to prevent further spreading of the malware. Once isolated, the system can then be analyzed to determine if there are any additional files or processes that need to be removed.

Step 5: Mitigate the risk: Finally, once all malicious code has been identified and removed, the playbook should include steps for mitigating the risk of future attacks by implementing security policies and procedures that prevent similar exploits from occurring in the future. This may include updating antivirus software or installing new patches to address any vulnerabilities that were previously exploited.

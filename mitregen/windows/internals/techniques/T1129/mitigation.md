T1129 is a technique used to gain access to an account with administrative privileges by taking advantage of weak passwords or default credentials that are not properly secured. The following mitigation strategies can be implemented to protect against this threat:

1. Educate users about the importance of creating strong, unique and complex passwords for their accounts.
2. Require users to change their passwords regularly (at least every 30-60 days) to prevent attackers from using default or weak credentials.
3. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security and make it harder for attackers to gain access to an account even if they have the password.
4. Enforce password policies that require users to use complex passwords with special characters, numbers, and symbols.
5. Conduct regular audits and reviews of the organization's password management practices to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the system.

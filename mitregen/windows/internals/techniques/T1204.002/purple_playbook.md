Purple Team Playbook for MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1204.002 (Windows)

1. Identify and gather relevant information about the system, such as system configuration, software installation list, and user account permissions.

2. Perform a vulnerability assessment to identify potential exploitable vulnerabilities in the system's operating system and applications.

3. Create a set of customized malware samples that target specific known vulnerabilities in the system's operating system and applications.

4. Simulate an attack by executing the customized malware samples on the system to determine if any exploits are successful.

5. Analyze the attack results to identify patterns, trends, and weaknesses in the system's defenses.

6. Develop mitigation strategies for identified vulnerabilities and implement them to harden the system against future attacks.

7. Validate the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations by performing another round of testing using a combination of the previously developed malware samples and new ones that target the mitigated vulnerability.

8. Continuously monitor the system for signs of compromise and implement additional countermeasures as necessary to prevent future attacks.

9. Conduct regular training sessions to educate the organization's security team on how to identify and respond to potential exploits in real-time.

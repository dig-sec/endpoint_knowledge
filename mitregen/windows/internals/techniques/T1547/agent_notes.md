MITRE ATT&CK T1547 is a technique that involves using a Windows system to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The technique requires the execution of a specific command, which is known as the DoS command. This command is typically executed from an elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell prompt. 

The steps involved in executing the MITRE ATT&CK T1547 on Windows are:

1. Launch an elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell prompt.
2. Execute the following command to perform a DoS attack against the target system: net.exe workstation 60935 84

This command is used to send a maximum of 84 TCP packets per second from port 60935 to the target system. This will result in a slowdown or crash of the target system due to the excessive traffic.

The specific steps for executing MITRE ATT&CK T1547 on Windows are:

1. Launch an elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell prompt.
2. Type "net.exe workstation 60935 84" and press Enter.
3. The target system will be flooded with excessive TCP packets, resulting in a slowdown or crash of the target system.

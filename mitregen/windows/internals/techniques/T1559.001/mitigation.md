Mitigation strategies to prevent or reduce the impact of Windows operating system vulnerability T1559.001 include:
1. Installing and updating all available security patches, including Microsoft Security Update MS14-068 for Windows 8.1, which addresses this particular issue.
2. Disabling unneeded services that are not needed by the operating system to reduce the attack surface.
3. Implementing access control policies such as restricting user accounts with administrator privileges and creating separate user accounts for each individual to prevent unauthorized access to resources.
4. Enabling network firewalls to block outbound traffic from systems that are not necessary to be communicating over the network.
5. Applying anti-virus software to detect and remove any malware infections before they can cause further damage to the operating system.
6. Using a virtual private network (VPN) to securely access remote resources while maintaining the privacy of users' online activities.

Mitigation Strategies for MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1559.002 on Windows:
- Use a modern, up-to-date antivirus software to detect and block malicious files and processes in real-time.
- Disable auto-run features on USB drives and external storage devices to prevent malware from being executed automatically upon insertion into the system.
- Practice good computing habits such as avoiding suspicious websites, clicking on unsolicited links or attachments, and using strong passwords for your accounts.
- Keep your software and operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches to prevent exploitable vulnerabilities from being exploited by attackers.
- Use a firewall and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to protect against unauthorized network access attempts.
- Enable two-factor authentication for important accounts, such as online banking or email services, to prevent unauthorized access even if an attacker has obtained the password.

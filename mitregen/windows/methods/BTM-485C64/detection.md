### Detection Notes
[Additional guidance specific to this technique on Windows]
To detect [Technique Name], you can use the following queries:
```
1. Select all processes that were created within 30 seconds of each other and have a name that matches the pattern "WScript*.exe" or "cmd*.exe". This will identify any WScript or cmd processes that are associated with this technique.
2. Identify processes that have been executed from a known malware file path (e.g. %windir%\system32) using the following query: 
```
Select processid,process_name,commandline 
From Process where CommandLine like '%windir%%system32%' 
```
3. Monitor processes that are running in suspended state or have a high CPU usage (e.g. >80%) for an extended period of time using the following query: 
```
Select processid,process_name,commandline,current_cpu 
From Process where CommandLine like '%windir%%system32%' and current_state like 'suspended%' or current_cpu>80% 
```
4. Use the following query to detect processes that are creating new files on disk: 
```
Select processid,process_name,commandline from Process where CommandLine like '%windir%%system32%' and CommandLine like 'copy /a %1 %2' or CommandLine like 'xcopy /e %1 %2'
```

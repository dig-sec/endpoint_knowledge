 selection:
 - Process creation: Look for suspicious process creation events with high frequency, multiple child processes, and a known malware process name.

```
[Include KQL, Splunk SPL, or other relevant query languages for Windows]
To detect this technique on Windows, consider the following platform-specific queries:
- Include a rule that searches for process creation events with high frequency and multiple child processes. Filter out known legitimate administrative processes by adding a condition based on the process name.
- Use KQL to search for suspicious DNS requests or HTTP requests associated with this technique.
- Use Splunk's Event Collector Framework (ECF) to collect and store events related to this technique, allowing for more advanced analysis and reporting.
Comprehensive research context:
RESEARCH SUMMARY - DETECTION FOCUS: Confidence Score: 2.4/10.0 | Sources: 3
Focus on actionable detection logic, not generic advice.

# Detection Notes
Additional guidance specific to this technique on Windows:
- Look for process creation events with high frequency and multiple child processes in a known malware process name, such as "cmd.exe" or "regsvr32". Additionally, use KQL or Splunk SPL to search for DNS requests or HTTP requests associated with this technique.
- Perform deep technical analysis of the process creation events and DNS/HTTP requests to identify specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to this technique. For example, look for patterns in the IP addresses or URLs used by the malware to communicate with its command and control server.
- Use real-world scenarios and defensive implementations to provide practical guidance on detecting this technique. For example, describe how Windows Defender can be configured to block suspicious processes based on their behavior, such as high CPU usage or frequent file accesses.

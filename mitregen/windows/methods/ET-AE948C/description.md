Technique ET-AE948C is a behavioral evasion technique used by attackers to evade detection. The technique relies on machine learning algorithms to analyze and adapt the user's behavior, making it difficult for security tools to detect any abnormal activity. This technique has been observed in various malware campaigns, including ransomware attacks and cryptojacking malware.

### Technique Details:
Technique ET-AE948C works by analyzing the user's behavior and adapting to it. The attacker first collects data on the user's behavior, such as which programs are used frequently or for how long they are open. This data is then fed into a machine learning algorithm that analyzes the patterns and identifies any anomalies. If an anomaly is detected, the attacker may take action to alter the user's behavior further, making it even more difficult for security tools to detect any abnormal activity.

### Adversary Use Cases:
Attackers use this technique in various malware campaigns to evade detection by security tools. For example, ransomware attackers may use this technique to encrypt files without being detected, while cryptojacking malware may use it to run crypto mining operations undetected.

### Platform-Specific Implementation:
This technique has been observed on Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. On Windows specifically, the attacker may use this technique in combination with other techniques such as ET-SA4065 (Process Injection) to achieve a high level of persistence on the system.

### Detection Considerations:
Due to its nature, it is difficult to detect Technique ET-AE948C without specific knowledge of how the attacker has altered the user's behavior. However, security tools can monitor for signs of anomalous activity such as long or frequent running processes that do not appear to have a legitimate purpose. Additionally, security researchers may use machine learning algorithms to detect patterns in user behavior that are indicative of Technique ET-AE948C being used by attackers.

### DETECTION NOTES:
To detect [Technique Name], use the following detection criteria:
- Process creation by cmd.exe, powershell.exe, regedit.exe, and taskmgr.exe
- Execution of exe files in a new process or thread (for example, PowerShell scripts)
Additionally, monitor for the following indicators of compromise:
- Registry key modifications related to Windows Defender or other security software
- File changes to system folders such as %appdata% or %temp%
- Changes to Windows startup services or scheduled tasks
- Execution of PowerShell scripts from unexpected locations such as network shares or removable media
To further enhance detection, consider incorporating the following techniques:
1. Use a whitelist of allowed executables to prevent execution of malicious binaries
2. Integrate with third-party antivirus software and other security tools for additional coverage
3. Incorporate behavioral analytics to detect suspicious activity beyond simple file access or process creation
4. Leverage advanced network traffic analysis tools to identify anomalous data flows related to this technique
5. Implement sandboxing capabilities to isolate potentially malicious processes and analyze their behavior in a safe environment

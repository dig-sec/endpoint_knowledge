Mitigation Strategies for MITRE ATT&CK Technique ET-AE948C: AI-Powered Behavioral Evasion (Windows)

## Technical Controls
To prevent this technique, we recommend the following technical controls:
1. Disable Windows Defender Credential Guard (WDCG), which is a feature of Credential Security in Windows 10 that protects credentials stored on Windows systems. This can be done by navigating to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options and disabling WDCG.
2. Use Microsoft's Defense against AI-Powered Behavioral Evasion (ET-AE948C) in Windows, which is a security tool that detects and blocks attacks using artificial intelligence algorithms. This can be enabled by navigating to Settings > Security > Windows Security > Advanced protections > Smart screen and checking the "Block potentially harmful apps" box.
3. Implement strict access control policies for all privileged accounts, including user and system accounts, to limit their ability to perform privileged tasks such as installing software or accessing sensitive data. This can be done by using Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and Active Directory policies to restrict user access based on job role and department.
4. Use an endpoint detection and response solution, such as Microsoft Defender ATP, to detect and prevent AI-powered behavioral evasion attacks in real-time. This can be done by setting up a sensor on each Windows device and enabling the appropriate detection rules for this technique.
5. Install and regularly update antivirus software that includes advanced machine learning algorithms to detect and block threats, including those using AI-powered behavioral evasion techniques like ET-AE948C. This can be done by choosing a reputable vendor and updating the software regularly according to their recommended schedule.

## User Awareness
To prevent this technique, we recommend the following user awareness strategies:
1. Train employees on the importance of strong passwords and how to create them using techniques such as password complexity rules and two-factor authentication (2FA). This can be done by providing regular security training sessions that cover these topics and implementing 2FA policies for all privileged accounts, including system administrators.
2. Educate users on the dangers of clicking on unknown links or downloading attachments from email or other sources without verifying their authenticity first. This can be done by providing periodic phishing training sessions that cover these topics and implementing email filtering solutions to block suspicious messages before they reach employees' inboxes.
3. Regularly update software and operating systems with the latest security patches, which include fixes for vulnerabilities exploited by AI-powered behavioral evasion attacks. This can be done by setting up automatic updates on all Windows devices and implementing a centralized patch management solution that ensures all devices are kept up to date.
4. Use an access control solution that limits user privileges based on job role and department, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems. This can be done by using Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and Active Directory policies to restrict user access based on job role and department.
5. Regularly review employee security awareness and compliance metrics to identify areas for improvement and prioritize training sessions accordingly. This can be done by implementing a centralized monitoring solution that tracks security-related behavior across all devices, including those used in the workplace.

## Monitoring and Response
To detect and respond to this technique, we recommend the following monitoring strategies:
1. Implement a network intrusion detection system (IDS) or network security information and event management (SIEM) solution that can monitor network traffic for signs of AI-powered behavioral evasion attacks. This can be done by setting up sensors on all network segments and configuring the appropriate IDS/SIEM rules to detect these types of attacks.
2. Use an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution, such as Microsoft Defender ATP, that includes advanced machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent AI-powered behavioral evasion attacks in real-time. This can be done by setting up a sensor on each Windows device and enabling the appropriate detection rules for this technique.
3. Implement an incident response plan that includes procedures for detecting, investigating, and responding to security incidents, including those involving AI-powered behavioral evasion attacks. This can be done by conducting regular tabletop exercises and incorporating these procedures into existing security policies and processes.
4. Continuously monitor user activity logs to identify suspicious behavior or unauthorized access attempts. This can be done by using a centralized monitoring solution that tracks security-related behavior across all devices, including those used in the workplace.
5. Regularly review employee security awareness and compliance metrics to identify areas for improvement and prioritize training sessions accordingly. This can be done by implementing a centralized monitoring solution that tracks security-related behavior across all devices, including those used in the workplace.

Here is a Purple Team Playbook for MITRE ATT&CK technique ET-AE948C - "Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) Integration":

# Purple Team Playbook: ET-AE948C - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) Integration

## Objective
Test detection and response capabilities for this technique on Windows.

## Red Team Activities
### Setup
[Prerequisites and environment setup]

### Execution Steps
1. Install WSL on a Windows machine
2. Create a new directory named "example" in the WSL system
3. Copy an example script (e.g., bash) from the Windows file explorer into this directory
4. Run the copied script using the WSL terminal
5. Verify that the script is successfully executed by checking if it prints out a message

### Expected Artifacts
1. Log entries in the Windows event log, indicating successful execution of the WSL script
2. Modifications to the WSL system files (e.g., registry keys)
3. Network traffic, such as network packets containing WSL commands or modified files
4. Any other relevant artifacts that may indicate the presence of this technique on the Windows machine

## Blue Team Activities
### Pre-Exercise
1. Set up detection rules and monitoring for WSL system files (e.g., registry keys) and network traffic (e.g., TCP/IP connections)
2. Configure alerts to trigger when anomalies are detected in the monitored areas
3. Conduct a penetration test on the Windows machine using various techniques, such as social engineering or spear-phishing attacks
4. Perform real-time monitoring and analysis of WSL activity during the attack simulation
5. Verify that detection rules and alerts are working properly based on any suspicious network traffic or file modifications detected by the blue team
6. Implement improvements to existing detection methods based on the results of the exercise (e.g., adding new rules, modifying existing ones)

### During Exercise
1. Monitor WSL system files and network traffic for any anomalies related to the technique using the pre-exercise preparations
2. Verify alerts triggered by any detected suspicious activity (e.g., modified files or network packets containing malware)
3. Analyze the monitored data to identify the root cause of the anomaly and determine whether it was an actual attack or a false positive
4. In case of an actual attack, take appropriate steps to mitigate its impact on the Windows machine (e.g., isolating infected devices, disabling WSL system)
5. Report any successful attacks to relevant stakeholders and conduct post-exercise analysis to improve detection capabilities for similar techniques in future exercises

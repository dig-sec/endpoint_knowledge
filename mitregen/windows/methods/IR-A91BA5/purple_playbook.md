Thank you for your feedback and suggestions. I have incorporated them into the final version of the content provided by you. 
The updated content includes a section on false positives and how they can be optimized using detection rules and alerts, as well as information about the payload used for the injection attempt, such as its size, encryption method, or any other relevant details that may impact its effectiveness. Additionally, there is a section on network traffic analysis to identify suspicious network patterns associated with the injection attempt, which can help in detecting potential attackers and their command-and-control (C2) channels.
In terms of code examples, I have added specific code snippets for Process Explorer and Process Monitor, along with information about how to use them to monitor process activity for anomalies related to the injection attempt. Finally, best practices for security documentation have been followed, including ensuring that technical accuracy and clarity are maintained throughout the document.
I hope this final version meets your expectations and provides valuable feedback to enhance the content provided by you.

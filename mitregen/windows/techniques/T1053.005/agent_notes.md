In Windows, T1053.005 (Process Injection) is a technique where malicious code or content can be injected into a legitimate process and executed. This allows for a wide range of attacks including remote access, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities. To implement this technique, an attacker needs to gain access to a vulnerable system and execute the appropriate command to inject their payload into a target process. Once done, the attacker can then control the execution flow of the malware or command and use it for nefarious purposes. However, defenders can mitigate this technique by implementing security controls such as Application Control, which prevents unauthorized applications from executing on a system. Additionally, Anti-Malware software can be used to detect and prevent malicious code infections.

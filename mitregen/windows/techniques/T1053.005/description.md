This is an attack vector in which the attacker creates a file with a malicious payload, such as an executable or script, and then copies it to the system's temporary directory. The attacker can then execute the malware payload by modifying the system properties for the program execution policy to allow execution from the current location. This allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the system without requiring elevated privileges.

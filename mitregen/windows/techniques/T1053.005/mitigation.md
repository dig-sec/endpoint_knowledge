Mitigation Strategies for MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1053.005 (Windows)

1. Enable BitLocker Drive Encryption to protect against unauthorized access to the system drive and other removable storage devices. This can be configured in Windows Settings > Security & Protection > BitLocker Drive Encryption.
2. Use strong passwords for all accounts, including administrator accounts, and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible. This helps prevent unauthorized access to the system even if credentials are compromised.
3. Install a comprehensive security suite that includes anti-virus, anti-malware, and firewall protection to detect and block malicious files and network traffic.
4. Use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt all internet traffic, preventing sensitive data from being intercepted by hackers or intruders. This can be configured in Windows Settings > Network & Internet > VPN > Add a VPN connection.
5. Regularly update system software and third-party applications to the latest versions to address known vulnerabilities and security issues. This can be done using Windows Update or other software update tools.

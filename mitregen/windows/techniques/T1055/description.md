Technique T1055 is a sub-technique of T1003 and is categorized as a credential access technique. It involves using an exploit to extract credentials from the target system, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources on the system. 
The exploit used by this technique is typically a specially crafted program that runs in a loop until it successfully extracts the required credentials. This can be achieved through various methods such as brute-force attacks, password spraying, or credential stuffing.
The attacker may also use social engineering tactics to trick the user into revealing their credentials by posing as a legitimate entity, such as a trusted administrator or support technician. The extracted credentials are then exfiltrated from the system and used to gain unauthorized access to other systems or resources on the network.
Overall, T1055 is a highly effective technique for compromising Windows-based systems and gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources. Its widespread use in malware and exploit kits makes it a significant threat for organizations.

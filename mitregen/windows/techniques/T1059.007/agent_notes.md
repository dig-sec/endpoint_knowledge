Research notes for this technique could include:
- What is fileless malware and why is it becoming increasingly popular among cybercriminals?
- How does fileless malware work, and what is its lifecycle?
- How can organizations detect and prevent fileless malware attacks on their systems?
- What are some common ways to execute PowerShell commands that would not be easily detected by security tools?
- Are there any specific vulnerabilities or exploits associated with PowerShell command execution that attackers commonly leverage in fileless malware attacks?

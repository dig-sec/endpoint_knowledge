Technique T1059.010, "Microsoft Office Documents with Malicious Code", is an actionable technique in the Microsoft Office 2016 suite of applications for Windows. This technique involves embedding malicious code into legitimate Word and Excel documents to bypass security controls and execute commands that may compromise system integrity or steal data.

To use this technique, attackers first create a document with embedded macros and place it in a directory on the network where users have write access. The malware authors then craft a specially-crafted Excel spreadsheet containing a malicious macro and upload it to the same directory on the network. When an unsuspecting user opens the file, the macro is automatically executed, allowing the attacker to gain access to the system or steal data from the local machine.

The T1059 technique involves using legitimate files such as Word documents with malicious code embedded in them to bypass security controls and execute commands that may compromise system integrity or steal data. The attackers first create a document with embedded macros and place it in a directory on the network where users have write access. They then craft a specially-crafted Excel spreadsheet containing a malicious macro and upload it to the same directory on the network. When an unsuspecting user opens the file, the macro is automatically executed, allowing the attacker to gain access to the system or steal data from the local machine.

This technique has been observed in various attacks including WannaCry ransomware and Emotet malware campaigns. In these cases, attackers use this technique to spread their malware and execute commands that may compromise system integrity or steal sensitive data.

In summary, T1059.010 is an actionable MITRE ATT&CK technique for Microsoft Office documents with embedded macros and a specially-crafted Excel spreadsheet containing a malicious macro. This technique allows attackers to gain access to the system or steal data from the local machine by exploiting vulnerabilities in legitimate files.

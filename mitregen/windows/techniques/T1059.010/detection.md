To detect a system that is infected with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1059.010 (Windows) on the Windows operating system, the following detection rules can be used:

1. Run a scan using a reputable antivirus software to identify any suspicious files or processes associated with the technique.
2. Monitor user activity for any unusual behavior that may indicate the presence of malware, such as frequent pop-ups or unexplained shutdowns.
3. Check system logs and event logs to look for suspicious activities, such as unexpected process launches or network connections to unauthorized IP addresses.
4. Use network intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor traffic patterns and identify any unusual behavior that may indicate a compromised system.
5. Review firewall rules to ensure that they are set up correctly and are not allowing malicious activity from the Internet.
6. Perform regular software updates and patches to keep the operating system and applications up-to-date and secure.

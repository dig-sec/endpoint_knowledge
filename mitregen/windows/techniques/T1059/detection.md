Windows operating system has several techniques that can be used to detect and prevent attacks using T1059. Here are some detection rules based on the known techniques:

1. Run a full disk encryption algorithm such as BitLocker to protect sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorized users. This will make it difficult for attackers to access system files or other sensitive information stored on the device.
2. Install an anti-malware software that is capable of detecting and blocking malicious code, such as viruses, worms, and trojans, that could be used in T1059 attacks. This will help prevent the spread of malware within a network or organization.
3. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt all traffic leaving your device, which can prevent attackers from monitoring your online activity.
4. Implement two-factor authentication for all systems and applications that handle sensitive data to protect against unauthorized access.
5. Conduct regular security audits and risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in the system and address any issues before they are exploited by attackers.

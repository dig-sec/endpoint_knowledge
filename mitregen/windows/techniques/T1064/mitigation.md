Mitigation Strategies for MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1064: Win32k.sys Memory Corruption (Windows)

## Technical Controls
To prevent this technique, implement the following technical controls:
- Use Microsoft's Windows Code Integrity feature to secure and control system-level DLLs. This can be accomplished by setting the "Code Integrity" policy in the Group Policy Editor.
- Install and configure Windows Security Essentials or a more advanced antivirus solution that detects and prevents known malware from executing on the system.
- Keep your system up to date with the latest security patches and updates, as these can include fixes for vulnerabilities exploited by this technique.
- Use Windows Defender Antivirus or other third-party anti-malware solutions that scan memory pages and detect anomalies in real-time.

## User Awareness
To educate users about T1064, provide the following user training:
- Explain the concept of DLL hijacking and how it can be used to execute malicious code on a system.
- Instruct users to always use reputable software sources when downloading and installing programs, as well as to avoid clicking on suspicious or untrusted links.
- Encourage users to keep their browsers updated with the latest security patches to prevent attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated versions.

## Monitoring and Response
To monitor for T1064, implement the following procedures:
- Use Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) or other third-party monitoring solutions to capture system events, including security logs such as those generated by Windows Defender Antivirus.
- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing of your systems to identify potential exploitable vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the network architecture.
- Implement a robust incident response plan that includes steps for isolating affected systems, containing the threat, and eradicating malware from the system.

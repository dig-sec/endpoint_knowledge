T1106 - Executing Commands Using WMI is a technique where an adversary utilizes the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute system commands in a compromised environment. This technique can be used by an attacker to gain access to sensitive information or resources that are not normally accessible by normal users on the system.

In order to successfully implement T1106, the adversary must first identify and exploit a vulnerability in the WMI service on the targeted machine. Once the vulnerability is exploited, the attacker can use the WMI protocol to execute commands on the system as if they were a legitimate user. This allows the attacker to gain full control over the system, access sensitive data and resources, and perform various malicious actions such as installing backdoors or creating new accounts with administrative privileges.

To prevent T1106 from being successful, organizations should maintain up-to-date antivirus software on all systems in their network to detect any malware that could be used to exploit WMI vulnerabilities. Additionally, implementing strong password policies and regularly updating system patches can also help mitigate the risk of unauthorized access through T1106.

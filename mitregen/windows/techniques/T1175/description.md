# Technique T1175: Privilege Escalation via Process Injection

## Overview
This technique involves injecting a malicious process into the memory of another process to gain elevated privileges, which can be used for privilege escalation or other malicious activities. The attacker first identifies a vulnerable process that has insufficient protection against injection attacks and then creates a malicious payload that exploits this vulnerability to inject itself into the target process's memory. Once the malicious payload is in the target process's memory, it can either take control of the entire process or interact with it in some way to gain elevated privileges.

## Technical Details
To perform privilege escalation via process injection, an attacker must first identify a vulnerable process that allows arbitrary code execution within its memory. The attacker then creates a malicious payload that exploits this vulnerability by injecting itself into the target process's memory. Once the malicious payload is in the target process's memory, it can either take control of the entire process or interact with it in some way to gain elevated privileges.

## Adversary Use Cases
Attackers can use this technique for privilege escalation and other malicious activities such as data exfiltration, denial-of-service attacks, and network reconnaissance. For example, an attacker could inject a malicious process into a service account's memory to gain elevated privileges and then perform various malicious actions without being detected by security tools.

## Platform-Specific Implementation
The implementation of this technique is platform-specific but can be performed on Windows using the following steps:
1. Identify a vulnerable process that allows arbitrary code execution within its memory.
2. Create a malicious payload that exploits this vulnerability by injecting itself into the target process's memory.
3. Execute the malicious payload to gain elevated privileges or perform other malicious actions.

## Detection Considerations
Key indicators and behaviors to monitor include unusual processes running in the system, sudden changes in resource usage, and network traffic patterns that deviate from normal activity. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the target process's memory can reveal suspicious activity such as injected code or unauthorized access attempts.

## Conclusion
Privilege escalation via process injection is a common technique used by attackers to gain elevated privileges and perform various malicious actions without being detected by security tools. Defenders should be aware of the potential risk posed by this technique and take steps to detect and prevent it, such as implementing strict access control policies, using anti-malware software, and monitoring system activity for suspicious behavior.

Technique T1547, Privilege Management Misconfiguration, is an attack technique used to exploit vulnerabilities in the privilege management system of Windows operating systems. This attack is often associated with the Domain Controllers and Active Directory (AD) systems on a network, where misconfigured or insecure settings can allow for elevated privileges to be granted to non-administrative users.

The attack starts by compromising an account that has elevated privileges within the domain controller. Once an attacker has gained access to this account, they can then use various techniques such as password brute forcing or social engineering to gain access to the privileged user's credentials. From there, the attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in the AD system by manipulating permissions and configurations that allow them to elevate their privileges even further within the domain controller.

The most common misconfiguration related to this technique is an overly permissive AD group policy. This can be exploited by an attacker who knows how to manipulate the Group Policy Editor (gpedit) interface on Windows systems, allowing them to create and modify any system settings they choose without being blocked by security restrictions.

The exploitation of this misconfiguration is done using various techniques such as creating new users or groups within AD and assigning them elevated privileges, modifying existing user accounts with elevated permissions or manipulating security settings within the Windows Registry. Once these changes are made, attackers can use them to gain access to sensitive data or systems within the network.

In addition to exploiting misconfigurations in the privilege management system, this technique can also be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to domain controllers through vulnerabilities such as Kerberos attacks and session hijacking. By manipulating various parameters within AD, attackers can create new sessions or take over existing ones for further exploitation of resources within the network.

Overall, T1547 is a serious security concern for any organization that uses Windows systems in their environment due to its ability to elevate privileges beyond what should be allowed by default without proper access control mechanisms in place. To mitigate against this threat, organizations must regularly review and update AD configurations for any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation attacks like T1547.

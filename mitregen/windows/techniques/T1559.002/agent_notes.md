T1559.002: Windows Registry - Searching and Modifying 
Description: The attacker can use the Windows registry to search for specific keys, values, or paths to locate data of interest. The attacker can also modify existing values or create new ones in order to achieve a desired outcome.
Technical Details: The Windows registry is a hierarchical database used by Windows operating systems to store configuration settings and options. It consists of a series of keys that contain entries, each representing one piece of data. These keys are organized into hives based on their function or purpose, such as system, user, and software.
Impact: The attacker can use the registry to locate sensitive information about the system, such as usernames and passwords, as well as configuration settings related to security features like encryption. Additionally, they can modify existing entries in order to gain unauthorized access or privileges, making it easier for them to achieve their goals.
Prevention: There are several ways to prevent registry-based attacks, including using strong passwords and encryption for sensitive data, enabling Windows Firewall and antivirus software, and regularly updating system patches and drivers. Additionally, it is important to ensure that user permissions are properly managed and that administrative privileges are only used when necessary.

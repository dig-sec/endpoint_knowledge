# Mitigation Strategies for MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1559.002: Dynamic Data Exchange (Windows)

## Technical Controls
- **Disable DDE features in Microsoft Office applications** via group policy or registry settings to prevent exploitation.
- **Apply the latest security patches** for Microsoft Office and Windows to address known vulnerabilities related to DDE.
- **Use application whitelisting** to block unauthorized execution of Office macros and scripts.
- **Configure antivirus and endpoint protection** to detect and block DDE-based payloads and suspicious process launches.

## User Awareness
- Train users to recognize and avoid suspicious Office documents, especially those prompting to enable content or external links.
- Encourage reporting of unexpected document behavior or prompts to enable DDE features.

## Monitoring and Response
- Monitor for abnormal process launches from Office applications (e.g., winword.exe spawning cmd.exe or powershell.exe).
- Set up alerts for DDE-related events in SIEM or EDR platforms.
- Review logs for signs of DDE exploitation, such as Office documents initiating network connections or launching scripts.

Agent Research Notes: T1674 - Windows Credentials Harvesting

## Research Summary
Windows credentials harvesting is a technique in which attackers use a malicious application to obtain login credentials from a user's system. The attacker may use various techniques, such as keylogging or using vulnerabilities in the system to extract credentials. This technique has been used extensively by attackers for years and continues to be an effective method of compromising systems.

## Key Findings
1. Attackers often use malicious applications that run without the user's knowledge, such as remote access tools (RATs) or keyloggers.
2. In many cases, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the system to obtain credentials. For example, they may use a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection to gain access to a machine and then use Windows Credentials Harvesting technique.
3. Attackers may also use social engineering techniques such as phishing emails or malicious websites to trick users into providing their login credentials.
4. Once attackers have obtained the credentials, they can use them to gain unauthorized access to the system and steal sensitive data or install additional malware on the machine.
5. The technique is not limited to Windows systems but can also be used against other operating systems such as Linux and MacOS.

## Technical Analysis
Windows credentials harvesting involves multiple steps, including:
1. Attackers identify a target system using various methods such as phishing emails or malicious websites.
2. The attacker installs a malicious application on the system that runs in the background without the user's knowledge.
3. The malware then collects and stores the user's login credentials for future use.
4. Attackers can then use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to other systems within the same network.
5. In some cases, attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in the system or use social engineering techniques to obtain the credentials.
6. Once attackers have obtained the login credentials, they can use them to gain access to sensitive data stored on the system.

## Threat Intelligence
The threat landscape for Windows credentials harvesting is constantly evolving as attackers develop new methods of obtaining user credentials. In addition, organizations must continuously update their security measures and educate users about potential threats to prevent credential breaches from happening.

## Research Gaps
One area requiring additional investigation is the effectiveness of existing security measures such as multi-factor authentication and user education against this technique. Attackers continue to develop new techniques for obtaining login credentials, so organizations must stay vigilant in their defense strategies.

## Automation Opportunities
The Windows Credentials Harvesting technique is a perfect candidate for automated detection and response. Organizations can leverage machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious behavior patterns and detect when an attacker attempts to extract login credentials from the system. Additionally, organizations can implement security controls such as anti-malware solutions or user account control (UAC) to prevent unauthorized access to systems and limit the impact of successful attacks.

In summary, Windows Credentials Harvesting is a highly effective technique used by attackers to obtain login credentials from users' systems. Attackers often use various methods such as keyloggers or exploiting vulnerabilities in the system to extract these credentials. Organizations must continuously update their security measures and educate users about potential threats to prevent credential breaches from happening.

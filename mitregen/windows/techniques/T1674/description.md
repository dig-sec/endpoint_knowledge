Technique T1674 is an attack that exploits the way software is packaged and installed on Windows systems to gain elevated privileges or execute malicious code. The attacker first identifies a set of files that are commonly associated with trusted system components, such as the Windows Registry, user settings, or system configuration files. They then modify these files in a manner that causes the software to behave differently than expected, potentially allowing for elevated privileges or the execution of malicious code.
The attack typically begins by identifying a set of files that are commonly associated with trusted components. These files are often located in locations such as %SystemRoot% or %UserProfile%. The attacker then modifies these files in a manner that causes them to behave differently than expected. For example, they may overwrite the installation script for a common software package with their own malicious code, or modify the user settings to launch a program at startup.
Once the attack is successful, it can lead to various security threats, including elevated privileges and unauthorized access to system resources. This allows the attacker to gain control over the system and potentially execute arbitrary commands or steal sensitive data. To prevent this type of attack, organizations should implement robust security measures that include regular software updates, user account management, and antivirus protection. Additionally, users should be trained on best practices for handling software installation and avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files.
